# Objectives of a Governance & IAM Architecture Review

The objective of the Cloud Governance & IAM Hardening Review is to:

1. Audit and improve identity and access structures (IAM) across cloud platforms.
2. Establish clear governance baselines to reduce operational, security, and compliance risks.
3. Provide actionable recommendations and architecture aligned with least privilege, traceability, and scalability.

## Identity & Access Management (IAM)

We conduct a deep evaluation of your IAM posture, including:

- Users, roles, policies, groups, and service accounts
- Cross-account access and privilege escalation vectors
- Role inheritance, group nesting, and permission boundaries
- Key rotation, secret handling, and inactive identities
- Logging and traceability of identity events

> IAM is your security perimeter in the cloud. Weakness here means exposure everywhere.

## Governance Architecture Assessment

We evaluate the maturity and structure of your governance model:

- Multi-account/project architecture and control domains
- Tagging, ownership enforcement, and metadata standards
- Policy as Code and centralized control frameworks (SCPs, OPA, Kyverno)
- Logging, alerting, and integrity baselines
- Financial and quota controls mapped to roles and teams

## Deliverables

You’ll receive a tailored report that includes:

- IAM security findings and critical misconfigurations
- Governance maturity analysis
- Remediation roadmap with prioritization (Quick Wins & Strategic Fixes)
- Reference architecture suggestions (roles, folders, policies)
- Optional: interactive session with your engineering team or CISO

## Strategic Impact

- Increased auditability and regulatory readiness
- Stronger security posture with clear accountability
- Less technical debt and IAM complexity
- Foundation for zero trust, FinOps, and compliance programs

Poor governance isn’t just messy, it’s a hidden liability.
A hardened IAM structure and clear policy framework turns your cloud into a secure, governed platform.

> Our governance blueprints are trusted by security teams, compliance auditors, and CTOs seeking institutional-grade clarity across cloud platforms.
