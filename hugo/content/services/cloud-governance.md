Cloud governance isn't bureaucracy — it's infrastructure discipline at scale.
We assess and strengthen your cloud access model and governance architecture to reduce risk, enhance visibility, and enable sustainable growth.

# Objectives

The objective of the Cloud Governance & IAM Hardening Review is to:

1. Audit and improve identity and access structures (IAM) across cloud platforms.
2. Establish clear governance baselines to reduce operational, security, and compliance risks.
3. Provide actionable recommendations and architecture aligned with least privilege, traceability, and scalability.

## Identity & Access Management (IAM)

We conduct a deep evaluation of your IAM posture, including:

- Users, roles, policies, groups, and service accounts
- Cross-account access and privilege escalation vectors
- Role inheritance, group nesting, and permission boundaries
- Key rotation, secret handling, and inactive identities
- Logging and traceability of identity events

> IAM is your security perimeter in the cloud. Weakness here means exposure everywhere.

## Governance Architecture Assessment

We evaluate the maturity and structure of your governance model:

- Organizational layout (multi-account/project strategy)
- Tagging enforcement and resource ownership
- Policy as Code (OPA, SCPs, Kyverno, etc.)
- Audit logging, configuration baselines, alerting rules
- Cost and resource boundaries (quotas, budgets)

## Deliverables

You’ll receive a tailored report that includes:

- IAM security findings and critical misconfigurations
- Governance maturity analysis
- Remediation roadmap with prioritization (Quick Wins & Strategic Fixes)
- Reference architecture suggestions (roles, folders, policies)
- Optional: interactive session with your engineering team or CISO

## Strategic Impact

- Increased auditability and regulatory readiness
- Stronger security posture with clear accountability
- Less technical debt and IAM complexity
- Foundation for zero trust, FinOps, and compliance programs

Poor governance isn’t just messy, it’s a hidden liability.
A hardened IAM structure and clear policy framework turns your cloud into a secure, governed platform.
