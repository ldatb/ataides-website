# Objectives of Executive Cloud Advisory

The objective of the External Cloud Strategy Advisory is to:

1. Support leadership in making informed, long-term decisions regarding cloud strategy.
2. Offer independent review of existing architectures, investments, and roadmaps.
3. Provide a trusted voice on cloud governance, security, and cost control — without vendor or internal bias.

## Advisory Focus Areas

Our advisory can include, but is not limited to:

- Cloud platform strategy and vendor independence
- Migration readiness (from legacy or hybrid environments)
- Lock-in mitigation and portability options
- Cost sustainability and FinOps discipline
- Architecture reviews for scale, continuity, or compliance
- Audit-facing posture and board alignment (ISO, SOC 2, GDPR, NIST)

> Cloud strategy is not a technical decision, it’s an institutional one.

## How We Work

We engage through short- or long-term advisory formats:

- **Retained advisory**: Monthly hours reserved for consultation, reviews, or board preparation
- **One-time assessments**: Architecture, risk, or governance review with executive summary
- **On-demand consulting**: Support during migrations, incidents, or key vendor negotiations

Sessions can include technical deep dives, stakeholder alignment, or documentation review.

## Deliverables

Depending on the engagement, you may receive:

- Executive briefs and strategic memos
- Architecture overviews and benchmarking
- Framework alignment reports (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001)
- Recommendations for team structure, tooling, or governance
- Optional: participation in board meetings or technical due diligence

## Strategic Impact

- Greater alignment between business and technical leadership
- Risk-informed decision-making with vendor-neutral guidance
- Stronger positioning for compliance, M&A, or growth initiatives
- Executive confidence in roadmap, spend, and cloud direction

> Cloud strategy isn’t just a technical choice, it’s a leadership decision. We help CTOs and boards lead with clarity, confidence, and foresight.
