# Objectives

The objective of the External Cloud Strategy Advisory is to:

1. Support leadership in making informed, long-term decisions regarding cloud strategy.
2. Offer independent review of existing architectures, investments, and roadmaps.
3. Provide a trusted voice on cloud governance, security, and cost control — without vendor or internal bias.

## Advisory Focus Areas

Our advisory can include, but is not limited to:

- Multi-cloud vs. single-cloud evaluation
- Platform migration (e.g. from legacy to cloud-native)
- Vendor risk and cloud lock-in strategies
- Cost predictability and FinOps alignment
- Architecture audits for scalability, resilience, or compliance
- Audit and board readiness (ISO, SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

> Strategic cloud decisions shape business velocity, risk exposure, and future costs — we help you see the full picture.

## How We Work

We engage through short- or long-term advisory formats:

- **Retained advisory**: Monthly hours reserved for consultation, reviews, or board preparation
- **One-time assessments**: Architecture, risk, or governance review with executive summary
- **On-demand consulting**: Support during migrations, incidents, or key vendor negotiations

Sessions can include technical deep dives, stakeholder alignment, or documentation review.

## Deliverables

Depending on the engagement, you may receive:

- Executive briefs and strategic memos
- Architecture overviews and benchmarking
- Framework alignment reports (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001)
- Recommendations for team structure, tooling, or governance
- Optional: participation in board meetings or technical due diligence

## Strategic Impact

- Greater alignment between business and technical leadership
- Risk-informed decision-making with vendor-neutral guidance
- Stronger positioning for compliance, M&A, or growth initiatives
- Executive confidence in roadmap, spend, and cloud direction

Cloud strategy isn’t just a technical choice, it’s a leadership decision.
We help CTOs and boards lead with clarity, confidence, and foresight.
