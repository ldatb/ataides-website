Security is not an add-on, it is a foundational layer of trust, resilience, and institutional integrity. Ataides helps organizations implement security architectures that are resilient by design, audit-aligned, and proportional to business risk.

# Objectives of Security Architecture & Resilience Review

The goal of Cloud Security is to ensure that:

1. Your infrastructure is protected by default, not retrofitted after deployment.
2. Access is controlled, encrypted, and monitored.
3. You meet the expectations of both security teams and regulators.

## Secure by Design

Security isn't a plugin, it’s an architectural layer.

We design cloud-native environments that enforce:

- Role-and-context-aware IAM (least privilege by architecture)
- KMS integration and Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
- Secure secrets lifecycle management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Zero-trust network architecture and microsegmentation
- Infrastructure immutability and tamper-evident change pipelines

## DevSecOps & Policy Automation

We embed security into your development and delivery lifecycle:

- Pre-deploy security controls in CI/CD pipelines
- Policy as Code with tools like OPA, Kyverno, and Conftest
- Static analysis and misconfiguration scanning
- GitOps flows with embedded approval logic and auditing

> Every deployment should be secure, intentional, and traceable.

## Monitoring & Detection

We implement cloud-native observability that enhances both security posture and audit readiness:

- Threat detection pipelines (Falco, GuardDuty, SCC)
- Centralized, immutable log collection and forensic readiness
- Alert governance and incident triage flow
- Seamless integration with enterprise SIEM and response platforms

## Compliance-Ready Security

We align your security architecture with compliance expectations from:

- ISO 27001
- NIST 800-53 / CSF
- SOC 2
- LGPD & GDPR (privacy-by-default principles)

> Security is what enables compliance and builds trust with users, partners, and regulators.
