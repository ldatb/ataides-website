Compliance in the cloud requires more than policies, it requires architecture that aligns with regulatory expectations from the ground up.
We help organizations build a clear, audit-ready cloud blueprint mapped to frameworks like ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST.

# Objectives

The objective of the Cloud Compliance Blueprint is to:

1. Map your cloud infrastructure against the controls required by regulatory frameworks.
2. Identify architecture and process gaps that affect audit readiness.
3. Provide a prioritized plan with actionable technical and policy improvements.

## Framework Alignment

We translate regulatory requirements into practical cloud-native architecture:

- ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A)
- SOC 2 (Security, Availability, Confidentiality)
- NIST 800-53 / NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- GDPR, CCPA, LGPD (where applicable)

> We act as the bridge between compliance checklists and your real infrastructure.

## Architecture & Control Mapping

We review your cloud platform(s) (no matter the provider) and assess:

- Logging, monitoring, and data retention
- IAM roles and segregation of duties (SoD)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Key management and secrets storage
- Backup and recovery strategy
- Configuration management and change tracking
- Network isolation and firewall rules

All mapped directly to framework-specific control requirements.

## Deliverables

You’ll receive a clear, structured blueprint including:

- Compliance gap analysis (per framework)
- Cloud architecture diagrams with annotated controls
- Control implementation plan (Quick Wins + Long-Term Actions)
- Templates for evidence generation (IAM, logs, policies)
- Compliance traceability matrix (Control → Cloud Component → Owner)

Optional: we can support engineering teams during implementation.

## Strategic Impact

- Accelerated audit preparation (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Clear justification of security posture to stakeholders
- Reduced compliance risk and future remediation effort
- Documentation to support external assessments or due diligence

Compliance isn’t a checkbox, it’s a design principle.
With the right blueprint, your cloud becomes an asset, not an audit liability.
