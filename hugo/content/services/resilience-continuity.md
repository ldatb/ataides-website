Availability is not resilience, and SLAs are not strategy. Ataides helps organizations assess and strengthen their cloud environments for real-world disruption, ensuring continuity with precision, visibility, and accountability.

# Objectives of Resilience & Continuity Readiness

The objective of the Business Continuity & RTO/RPO Cloud-Based Assessment is to:

1. Evaluate the resilience of your cloud architecture beyond SLAs and assumptions.
2. Map the recovery time (RTO) and data loss tolerance (RPO) of each critical service.
3. Provide an actionable plan to reduce downtime risk and improve response readiness.

## Resilience Assessment

We conduct a structured technical evaluation of your:

- Backup frequency, encryption, and multi-region durability
- Disaster recovery posture (warm, cold, multi-zone, multi-cloud)
- Auto-scaling, failover orchestration, and traffic shifting
- State handling for databases, queues, and persistent volumes
- Automated vs. manual recovery pipelines
- Dependencies: DNS, identity, secrets, monitoring

> Uptime means little if recovery takes hours or data is lost.

## RTO/RPO Modeling

We help define and validate recovery expectations, tolerances, and impact trade-offs:

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: how long can services be down?
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: how much data can be lost?
- Critical vs. non-critical services
- Acceptable trade-offs for cost vs. availability
- Visual impact matrix and dependency mapping

Optional: simulation scenarios or table-top exercises.

## Deliverables

You’ll receive a detailed continuity package including:

- Architecture review with resilience scoring
- RTO/RPO mapping per service/component
- Risk matrix of current state vs. business requirements
- Recommendations for architecture or process improvement
- Optional: response playbooks or DR test templates

## Strategic Impact

- Reduced downtime risk and business interruption
- Clear understanding of what’s recoverable — and how fast
- Foundation for ISO 22301, SOC 2 Availability Principle, or board-level reporting
- Increased confidence across technical and executive stakeholders

> True continuity isn’t about luck, it’s engineered into the architecture.
