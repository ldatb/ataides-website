Compliance is not a checklist, it is an architectural discipline. Ataides helps organizations design cloud environments that are secure, traceable, and audit-aligned from the ground up.

# Objectives of Regulatory Compliance Architecture

The objective of the Cloud Compliance Blueprint is to:

1. Map your cloud infrastructure against the controls required by regulatory frameworks.
2. Identify architecture and process gaps that affect audit readiness.
3. Provide a prioritized plan with actionable technical and policy improvements.

## Framework Alignment

We translate abstract compliance obligations into concrete, cloud-native architecture:

- ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A)
- SOC 2 (Security, Availability, Confidentiality)
- NIST 800-53 / NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- GDPR, CCPA, LGPD (where applicable)

> We act as the bridge between compliance checklists and your real infrastructure.

## Architecture & Control Mapping

We review your cloud platform(s) (no matter the provider) and assess:

- Logging, monitoring, and immutable retention policies
- IAM design aligned with role clarity and segregation of duties (SoD)
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit), KMS integration
- Key custody, secrets lifecycle, and access governance
- Backup validation, restore assurance, and RTO/RPO objectives
- Infrastructure configuration baselines and change integrity
- Network segmentation, firewall policies, and zero-trust enforcement

All mapped directly to framework-specific control requirements.

## Deliverables

You’ll receive a clear, structured blueprint including:

- Compliance gap analysis (per framework)
- Cloud architecture diagrams with annotated controls
- Control implementation plan (Quick Wins + Long-Term Actions)
- Templates for evidence generation (IAM, logs, policies)
- Compliance traceability matrix (Control → Cloud Component → Owner)

Optional: we can support engineering teams during implementation.

## Strategic Impact

- Accelerated audit preparation (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Clear justification of security posture to stakeholders
- Reduced compliance risk and future remediation effort
- Documentation to support external assessments or due diligence

> Compliance is not about passing an audit, it’s about proving institutional trust through architecture.
