Cloud governance isn't bureaucracy — it’s how you scale securely, sustainably, and with clarity.
We help organizations map technical and compliance risks, define policies, and implement governance structures that align with business strategy.

# Objectives

The objective of Governance & Risk Mapping is to:

1. Create clear ownership, policies, and accountability across cloud environments.
2. Identify gaps in compliance, access, cost control, and visibility.
3. Reduce operational and regulatory risk through intentional architecture.

## Cloud Governance Frameworks

We define and implement cloud-native governance structures:

- Organizational design (accounts, folders, projects)
- Role-based access models and IAM policies
- Resource hierarchy and naming conventions
- Logging, monitoring, and audit trail standards
- Policy enforcement with Policy as Code (OPA, Kyverno, AWS SCPs)

> Good governance makes scale safe and complexity manageable.

## Risk Identification & Mapping

We assess your cloud posture against a wide set of risks:

- Regulatory (GDPR, CCPA, LGDP, ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2)
- Technical (misconfigurations, exposure, service limits)
- Operational (availability, data lifecycle, change control)
- Financial (untracked costs, shadow IT, usage anomalies)

## Control Implementation

We help teams define and deploy controls that turn governance into action:

- Infrastructure as Code standardization
- Guardrails and pre-deployment validation
- Tagging and resource ownership policies
- Alerting and response workflows

## Business Alignment

Governance doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it reflects the business.

We ensure that your governance:

- Matches your team structure and process maturity
- Enables auditability without friction
- Supports reporting and decision-making
- Prepares you for compliance certifications and due diligence

Without governance, cloud becomes chaos.
With governance, it becomes an enabler of secure growth.
