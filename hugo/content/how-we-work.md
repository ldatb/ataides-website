Our process is built on discretion, structure, and institutional clarity.

Ataides works with organizations that demand strategic alignment, security assurance, and regulatory integrity, from architecture design to board-level insight.

### 1. Discovery & Qualification

We begin with a strategic intake session to understand your architecture, compliance obligations, internal structure, and business risk posture.

You’ll walk away with:

- A shared understanding of objectives
- Initial risk posture overview
- Fit and feasibility assessment

### 2. Scoped Proposal & Agreement

If there’s alignment, we formalize the engagement with:

- Defined outcomes and scope
- Work format (retainer, fixed-fee, sprints)
- Milestones and expected inputs
- Confidentiality or NDA terms (if applicable)

## 3. Structured Delivery

Engagements are executed with discipline:

- Access and briefing checklist
- Scheduled working sessions (if needed)
- Architecture reviews, documentation, or workshops
- Reports delivered in Markdown, PDF, or your internal format

We prioritize quality over noise. Every session has purpose. Every artifact has value.

### 4. Executive & Audit Alignment

For leadership and audit-facing workstreams, we provide:
- Executive summaries tailored to non-technical stakeholders
- Regulatory control mapping
- Architecture diagrams and risk memos
- Audit preparation or briefing materials

## 5. Transition & Follow-Up

At the end of each engagement, we ensure:

- Knowledge transfer to your team
- Documentation handoff
- Optional follow-up support
- Recommendations for continuity

## Typical Formats

We offer several engagement models depending on your needs:

| Format| Description|
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| One-time review | Architecture or compliance assessment with report |
| Sprint advisory | 2-4 weeks engagements with defined outcomes |
| Monthly retainer | Strategic advisory with reserved hours|
| On-demand | Available for boards, migrations, or critical events |

## Our Operating Principles

- Neutral and independent: no vendors, no conflicts
- Outcome-oriented: every engagement produces real artifacts
- Role-aware: we adapt to both boardroom and engineering contexts
- Integrity over sales: if it’s not a fit, we say so
