Ataides is a neutral and independent cloud advisory firm. We specialize in Cloud Architecture, Security, and Compliance, helping organizations build audit-ready infrastructure with institutional-grade discipline across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

This company was founded on a belief:

> **We don’t just engineer for performance, we engineer for resilience, sovereignty, and institutional trust.**

We work with clients who understand that cloud is not just a technical layer, but a strategic asset. That uptime means nothing without **integrity**. And that scaling fast is irrelevant if you can't scale **safely**.

## Our Philosophy

Our philosophy is informed by the institutional rigor and neutrality of the Swiss model, guided by precision, discretion, and long-term alignment with clients' strategic and regulatory interests.

- Cloud-agnostic, architecture-first thinking
- Confidential, trust-driven engagements
- Regulatory alignment as a baseline (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST, LGPD, GDPR)
- Governance and clarity as engineering principles
- Communication and documentation built for executive scrutiny

We don’t aim for buzzwords or shortcuts.
We aim for security, stability, and clarity at every layer.
