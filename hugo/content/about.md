Ataides is a neutral and independent cloud advisory firm. We specialize in Cloud Architecture, Security, and Compliance, helping organizations build audit-ready infrastructure with institutional-grade discipline across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

This company was founded on a belief:

> **We don’t just engineer for performance, we engineer for resilience, sovereignty, and institutional trust.**

We work with clients who understand that cloud is not just a technical layer, but a strategic asset. That uptime means nothing without **integrity**. And that scaling fast is irrelevant if you can't scale **safely**.

## Our Philosophy

Our philosophy is informed by the institutional rigor and neutrality of the Swiss model, guided by precision, discretion, and long-term alignment with clients' strategic and regulatory interests.

- Cloud-agnostic, architecture-first thinking
- Confidential, trust-driven engagements
- Regulatory alignment as a baseline (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST, LGPD, GDPR)
- Governance and clarity as engineering principles
- Communication and documentation built for executive scrutiny

We don’t aim for buzzwords or shortcuts.
We aim for security, stability, and clarity at every layer.

## Expertise Areas

- Cloud Infrastructure & Governance (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Secure Architecture & Access Control (IAM, encryption, DevSecOps)
- Regulatory Compliance & Risk Mapping
- Audit-Ready Infrastructure & Process Design
- Policy as Code & Automation (Terraform, Kubernetes, Vault, OPA)

## Why Trust Ataides

We operate independently, free from vendor incentives or cloud provider bias. Our work is grounded in institutional discipline and regulatory clarity, built for teams that need more than just technical expertise: they need trust.

- Vendor-neutral, architecture-first consulting  
- Confidentiality and long-term client alignment  
- Reputation built on clarity, not complexity

## Regulatory Precision

Compliance is not abstract, it’s technical. Ataides maps infrastructure components directly to the language of ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST, and privacy frameworks like LGPD and GDPR. Every recommendation we deliver includes control mapping and evidence guidance.

- Architecture-to-control traceability  
- Evidence collection design (Vaultum integration)  
- Control matrix alignment for auditors and CISOs

## Private Engagements

Some matters require deeper confidentiality. Ataides offers private consulting under strict NDA terms for clients dealing with sensitive regulatory, M&A, or post-incident transformation initiatives.

- Strict confidentiality and isolation from marketing channels  
- Custom threat models and compliance frameworks  
- Direct access to principal consultants only
