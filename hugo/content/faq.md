We work with cloud-native, regulated, and growing companies to align their architecture with business, risk, and compliance goals.

Here are some of the most common questions we receive:

### Do you work only with cloud-native companies?

No. While we specialize in cloud architecture and governance, we also help companies transitioning from legacy infrastructure or hybrid environments. What matters most is your commitment to evolving with discipline and clarity.

### If I already have an internal IT or DevOps team, why should I bring in external advisory?

We complement internal teams by focusing on strategic alignment, governance, compliance, and long-term risk reduction. Our work often includes assessments, architecture reviews, or compliance guidance that require neutrality, specialization, or external validation.

### Do you work with all cloud providers?

Yes. We support the main cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure) and smaller ones, including multi-cloud and hybrid environments. We’re vendor-neutral and focus on what makes sense for your business, not just the provider.

### Can you help us prepare for audits like ISO 27001 or SOC 2?

Absolutely. We map your existing architecture and processes to the controls required by these standards, helping your team identify gaps and generate the technical evidence auditors will expect.

### What frameworks do you follow?

We align our work with industry-recognized frameworks including ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, GDPR, LGPD, and CIS Benchmarks.

### How do you charge for your services?

We offer fixed-price projects, architecture reviews, and ongoing advisory retainers depending on the scope. Each engagement is scoped and priced transparently before any work begins. [See our services](/services) for more details.

### Do you sign NDAs?

Yes! We’re happy to sign your NDA or provide a mutual confidentiality agreement before discussing sensitive information.

### What size or type of company do you usually work with?

We work with both startups and established organizations, typically those going through growth, regulatory pressure, due diligence, or strategic cloud transformation. Our ideal client values clarity, governance, and security.

### Where are you based? Do you work globally?

We are based in Brazil and serve clients across the globe. All consultations can be conducted remotely and in English or Portuguese.
