Ataides works with organizations that demand institutional-grade trust in their cloud environments, including those in regulated sectors, rapid growth phases, or under strategic scrutiny.

Here are some of the most common questions we receive:

### Do you work only with cloud-native companies?

No. While we specialize in cloud architecture and governance, we also help companies transitioning from legacy infrastructure or hybrid environments. What matters most is your commitment to evolving with discipline and clarity.

### What value do you add if we already have internal DevOps or Security teams?

We bring external neutrality, regulatory specialization, and architectural clarity. Internal teams often focus on delivery, we focus on verification, compliance, and long-term resilience. We complement, not compete.

### Do you work with all cloud providers?

Yes. We support the main cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure) and smaller ones, including multi-cloud and hybrid environments. We’re vendor-neutral and focus on what makes sense for your business, not just the provider.

### Can you support audit readiness for ISO 27001, SOC 2, or similar?

Yes. We conduct architecture-to-control mapping, identify technical evidence gaps, and guide remediation to align with frameworks like ISO 27001 and SOC 2, helping you present an audit-ready environment with confidence.

### What frameworks do you follow?

We align our work with industry-recognized frameworks including ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, GDPR, LGPD, and CIS Benchmarks.

### How do you charge for your services?

We offer fixed-price projects, architecture reviews, and ongoing advisory retainers depending on the scope. Each engagement is scoped and priced transparently before any work begins. [See our services](/services) for more details.

### Do you sign NDAs?

Yes! We’re happy to sign your NDA or provide a mutual confidentiality agreement before discussing sensitive information.

### What size or type of company do you usually work with?

We work with both startups and established organizations, typically those going through growth, regulatory pressure, due diligence, or strategic cloud transformation. Our ideal client values clarity, governance, and security.

### Where are you based? Do you work globally?

We are based in Brazil and serve clients across the globe. All consultations can be conducted remotely and in English or Portuguese.

### What does “Swiss-grade governance” mean?

It means neutrality, discretion, and precision, applying institutional-level discipline to cloud architecture, security, and compliance. Like Swiss banks, we value trust, clarity, and strategic alignment above all.
