Regulatory compliance is no longer optional, especially in cloud environments handling sensitive or regulated data.
Our advisory services help organizations align their cloud operations with legal, privacy, and security standards, from infrastructure to policy.

# Objectives

The goal of Cloud & Data Compliance Advisory is to ensure that your cloud systems:

1. Comply with applicable data protection laws and frameworks (e.g. LGPD, GDPR, CCPA, ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2).
2. Have security controls that are provable, documented, and auditable.
3. Are architected with compliance by design, not as a retrofit.

## Regulatory Alignment

We translate legal obligations into technical implementation across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Our compliance mapping covers:

- GDPR, CCPA and LGDPA (data subject rights, retention, breach handling)
- ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A controls, risk assessments, policy structure)
- NIST CSF & SOC 2 (security, availability, confidentiality principles)

> We help your cloud speak the language of regulators, and vice versa.

## Privacy by Design

We assist with:

- Data classification and inventory in cloud-native environments
- Encryption strategies (at rest, in transit, BYOK/KMS)
- IAM scoping and access transparency
- Secure logging and traceability

## Audit-Readiness

Being compliant isn’t enough. You need to demonstrate it.
We help build environments and documentation that are ready for:

- Internal audits
- Regulatory inspections
- Certification processes (ISO, SOC 2, etc.)

Includes:

- Control mapping and evidence templates
- Policy and procedure alignment
- Data flow and processing documentation
- Governance dashboards and reporting structures

## Cloud Governance Integration

We embed compliance into infrastructure through:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) controls
- Policy as Code (OPA, Kyverno)
- Tagging and monitoring frameworks
- Cost-center accountability and access reviews

Compliance isn't about fear, it's about clarity, structure, and operational confidence.
