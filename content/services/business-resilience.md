Business continuity and resilience are the foundation of dependable cloud environments.
Our work ensures that your infrastructure not only stays online, but continues to operate securely, predictably, and in alignment with regulatory expectations.

# Objectives

The objective of a Business Continuity & Resilience Review is to assess whether your cloud infrastructure can:

1. Remain operational during disruptions and failure events.
2. Recover data and services efficiently and securely.
3. Maintain compliance through incidents.
4. Support business operations without compromise.

## Resilience Is a Strategy

We go beyond uptime. We evaluate how your architecture responds to:

- Regional outages
- Service degradation
- Human error
- Security incidents

> A resilient system isn’t one that avoids failure — it’s one that recovers intelligently and quickly.

## Disaster Recovery Frameworks

We design and validate recovery strategies across:

- AWS, GCP, and Azure
- Backup and versioning policies
- Multi-region and multi-zone deployments
- Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

All aligned with your business impact analysis and risk profile.

## Compliance Under Pressure

We ensure your continuity plans uphold compliance standards:

- LGPD & GDPR data protection during disaster scenarios
- ISO 27001 Annex A controls
- SOC 2 principles (Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity)
- Immutable logs and forensic readiness

> A compliant system must remain compliant even in a crisis.

## Observability and Alerting

Early detection and automated response are critical.
We assess:

- Monitoring and alert coverage
- On-call procedures and escalation paths
- Log integrity and retention
- Proactive anomaly detection

## Operational Readiness

Continuity isn’t a document - it’s a capability.
We work with your teams to establish:

- Runbooks and response playbooks
- Communication plans
- Test automation for recovery scenarios
- Ownership and accountability clarity
