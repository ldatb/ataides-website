Ataides is an independent consultant specializing in **Cloud Architecture**, **Security**, and **Compliance**. With experience across **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**, our work is rooted in precision, discretion, and neutrality - delivering outcomes that align both with business goals and regulatory standards.

This company was founded on a belief:

> **Infrastructure should not only perform — it should protect, govern, and endure.**

We work with clients who understand that cloud is not just a technical layer, but a strategic asset. That uptime means nothing without **integrity**. And that scaling fast is irrelevant if you can't scale **safely**.

## Our Philosophy

Inspired by principles often associated with Switzerland - **neutrality**, **institutional clarity**, **precision**, and **long-term trust** - our approach focuses on:

- **Confidential, high-trust relationships**
- **Regulatory alignment by design** (LGPD, GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2)

- **Documentation and communication that executives understand**

We don’t aim for buzzwords or shortcuts.
We aim for security, stability, and clarity - at every layer.
